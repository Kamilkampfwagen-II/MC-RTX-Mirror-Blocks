# MC-RTX-Mirror-Blocks
Texture packs to convert some vanilla blocks into mirrors.

- Mirror textured white glass
- Mirror textured activator rail

I chose those to retexture because they are the least common blocks suitable for purpose as the way I see.

Some tips:
- Both sides of activator rail has the same mirror texture. For those of you wondering.
- With mirror textured rails, you can create working periscopes. Their slope is exactly 45 degrees so they reflect the light at exactly 90 degrees.
- To place them in air you can use either glass or barrier block. You may need some kind of borderless glass block addon. For some reason, color information on entity models get lost when passing through two glass block with gap between them. You won't be able to see colors of things handled by entity model renderer like mobs, chests. To avoid this use barrier block instead. It has no refraction.
MC RTX's light bounce limit is 7, so mirrors rooms will have 14 reflections per dimension.
